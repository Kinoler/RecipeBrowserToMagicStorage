Allows you to filter items in your magic storage according to the selected item in the Recipe browser.

Magic storage:
Filters if the crafting or the storage panel is open.

Recipe browser:
Filters when the item selected in one of Recipe list, Ingrigient list or Items list.


By default filters by click on item only if the filter hot key is pressed in that moment. That behaviour can be changed in the config.

If you encounter any errors, please don't hesitate to create a ticket in my GitHub repository (https://github.com/Kinoler/RecipeBrowserToMagicStorage/issues), specifying your exact version of Terraria and TML.
